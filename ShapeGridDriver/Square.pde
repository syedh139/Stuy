/*===========================
  Square
  A Square is a RegularGon that must have exactly 4 sides.

  toString() should just return "Square"

  Write the entire Square class, only overriding the
  necessary methods to create a Square as described above,
  and using super appropriately.

  Read the comment at the top of ShapeGrid for an example
  of the requred constructor (line 15)
  =========================*/
  
  class Square extends Polygon{
    
   Square(int cx, int cy, int ss){
    super(4, cx, cy, ss); 
     
     
   }
    
    
    
    
    
    
  }
