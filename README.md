### UPDATES

### Work in some places
- I have added a lot of manual work.
- Add the variations of the shapes and avaible
- can you guys work on fuction shifter(CurrentShape)
- And keypress() --> When we press spacebar the shape shift to its other variation
- also add a score board
- make a function to keep track of the what is consider scored
- my way is finding a row where the all the arrays are white and score it 10 points
- MoveDown() make the objects go down. So can you guys make for left and right?
- Use the invader Homework for HINTs!
- Good Luck.

switch(CHOOSE){
  case 1:
  - We need to use Switch and cases to make this box randomly spawn on different design
  - I have resided to make the designs manually 
  - but we need to figure out how will we gonna transform the designs after words
  - for example the T - shaped box can go 4 ways and square (4 boxes) can go no way. It is on its own.
  - good luck and try to figure out why that shit is not moving as it suppose it.
